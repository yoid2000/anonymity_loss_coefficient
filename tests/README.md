`plots.py` runs some simple tests and also generates a variety of plots at `alc_plots` which convey the behavior of ALC.

Run from this directory (`python plots.py`) to generate the directory `alc_plots` in this directory.

Note you need to have pip installed `anonymity_loss_coefficient` first (in a venv, naturally)

`test_alcmanager.py` is a `pytest`test.
